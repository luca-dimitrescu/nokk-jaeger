        <div class="cats">
            <p>Katten (Felis catus), även kallad huskatt eller huskatt, är ett litet domesticerat köttätande däggdjur.
                Det är den enda domesticerade arten i familjen Felidae. Framsteg inom arkeologi och genetik har visat
                att domesticeringen av katten skedde i Främre Orienten omkring 7500 f.Kr.</p>

                    furry

                    <br> <br> Due
